# 100freelancers

100freelancers is a tool to keep track of potential web development freelance clients.

## :page_with_curl: About

100freelancers was originally created to help members of the 100devs agency keep track of their client outreach. Rather than using spreadsheets, which can be messy and difficult to read, 100freelancers can be used instead to easily add, view, and track clients, as well as progress made on client work.
